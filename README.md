## Setup

Create a Firebase App with a Firestore database and add a src/credentials.json file.

Example:

```
{
  "apiKey": "AIzaSyAF-131313",
  "authDomain": "pokemon-1212597.firebaseapp.com",
  "projectId": "pokemon-1212597",
  "storageBucket": "pokemon-de2197.appspot.com",
  "messagingSenderId": "97323232158313",
  "appId": "1:97784112412458313:web:42424212633ee6afdcf78"
}
```

This should be available to copy and paste directly after creating your firestore.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run addDocs`

This will post all Pokemon to your configured Firestore

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
